## About me.
I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others a public as possible. 

### Problem Solving (Algorithm) with JAVA
I think the knife works great when sharpened.
The same is true for problem-solving coding skills.
  
  These are my coding exercises collections that I learn and practice to solve problems from website like [greekforgreek.com](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), [leecode](https://leetcode.com/) etc. Also, code validity is driven by the TDD process.  
  
#### Basics, Greedy and Bit Manipulation
  - Reverse an array
  - Sum of Digits
  - Check if a Given String is Palindrome
